# Third-party notices and visual-asset provenance

## Build tools

- [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite), version **8.3.1**, MIT. Used as the development server and static build tool; full license and bundled dependency notices ship with the installed package at `node_modules/vite/LICENSE.md`.
- [vite-plugin-singlefile](https://github.com/richardtallent/vite-plugin-singlefile), version **2.3.3**, MIT. Used to inline the app into one distributable HTML; its full license ships at `node_modules/vite-plugin-singlefile/LICENSE`.
- Exact direct and transitive package versions and integrity values are retained in `package-lock.json`. These build dependencies are not a deployed application backend.
- The standalone HTML retains the full Phosphor MIT notice in an HTML comment, so the icon license accompanies the distributed SVG code.

## OverlayScrollbars

- Official upstream: [KingSora/OverlayScrollbars](https://github.com/KingSora/OverlayScrollbars), npm **2.16.0**.
- Exact release source: `dfa819688a529db0085c6416a94e816bfbaeaf29`.
- MIT, Copyright (c) 2022 Rene Haas. Full notice: [`web/assets/licenses/overlayscrollbars-MIT.txt`](web/assets/licenses/overlayscrollbars-MIT.txt), also embedded in the standalone HTML.
- The unmodified ESM and CSS package is bundled by Vite for body overlay scrollbars; the project configures auto-hide and supplies its own 6px theme. No scroll interpolation, framework wrapper, or optional click-scroll plugin is included.
- Evaluated alternatives and the Codrops visual reference: [`interface-restraint.md`](references/research/2026-09-27/interface-restraint.md). No SimpleBar or Codrops code/assets are bundled.

## Phosphor Icons

`web/js/icons.js` embeds 17 SVGs from the **regular** weight of Phosphor Icons.

- Official upstream: <https://github.com/phosphor-icons/core>
- Package version: `@phosphor-icons/core` **2.1.1**
- Exact commit: `2b75f3ad12b420c9504ef05df8d2564a28f8500e`
- Retrieved: **2026-09-26**
- License: **MIT**, Copyright (c) 2023 Phosphor Icons
- Original license: <https://github.com/phosphor-icons/core/blob/2b75f3ad12b420c9504ef05df8d2564a28f8500e/LICENSE>
- Local complete license: [`web/assets/licenses/phosphor-MIT.txt`](web/assets/licenses/phosphor-MIT.txt)
- Exact per-icon source URLs and source-content SHA256 values: [`web/assets/licenses/phosphor-sources.json`](web/assets/licenses/phosphor-sources.json)

The SVG paths, view boxes, and `currentColor` fill are retained. This project adds `class="icon"`, `width="1em"`, `height="1em"`, `aria-hidden="true"`, and `focusable="false"`, and embeds the SVG strings in a local ES module. The enclosing UI control supplies the accessible label. No Phosphor font, full icon package, or runtime dependency is loaded.

## AI-generated fictional concert imagery

The following images were generated for this project on **2026-09-26**, using the built-in OpenAI image generation tool:

- `web/assets/stage-scene.png`: audience-back view towards a fictional indoor stage.
- `web/assets/crowd-scene.png`: a side view across the crowd at the same imagined concert, using the first generated image only as a venue and lighting reference.

These are newly generated fictional scenes, not documentary photographs of a real event, user-uploaded memories, promotional artist photographs, or licensed music recordings. The prompts requested no brand, logo, text, watermark, identifiable celebrity, or specific real venue. Their common visual direction is dark ink-blue/teal audience lighting with warm coral stage light.

The images are not Phosphor assets and are not covered by Phosphor's MIT license. No third-party reference photographs were supplied. The original generated PNG outputs are copied into the project without cropping, repainting, or other image editing. Prompt and file provenance is recorded in [`web/assets/image-provenance.json`](web/assets/image-provenance.json).
## Runtime image encoding (2026-09-27)

Original generated PNG files remain unchanged. The app loads same-dimension WebP derivatives (`stage-scene.webp`, `crowd-scene.webp`) encoded with FFmpeg/libwebp at quality 88. No composition or content was changed. Hashes and sizes are in `web/assets/image-provenance.json`. FFmpeg is an authoring tool, not bundled in the app.

The backend uses built-in `node:http`, `node:crypto`, and `node:sqlite`, with no npm runtime dependencies. API references: [Node.js 24 SQLite](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v24.x/docs/api/sqlite.html), [Vite development proxy](https://vite.dev/config/server-options).

## Historical 0.2 / 0.3 video and cover authoring tools (2026-09-27)

- [HyperFrames](https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes), version **0.8.78**, [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes/blob/main/LICENSE). Used through the version-pinned CLI to render `delivery/video-source/index.html` and `cover.html`. The project does not vendor or distribute the HyperFrames CLI package.
- **GSAP 3.14.2**, [Standard “No Charge” GSAP License](https://gsap.com/community/standard-license/), Copyright (c) 2025 Webflow. The composition sources reference the unmodified [versioned CDN script](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gsap@3.14.2/dist/gsap.min.js); HyperFrames inlines it into the temporary rendering page. The official license page was checked on **2026-09-27**; its stated last modification date is **2025-05-30**. Proprietary notices in the library must be retained; this project does not modify the library or redistribute a local copy.

These are video-production tools only, not Music Map / Music Space application runtime dependencies. The delivered MP4 and PNG contain rendered imagery, not either tool's runtime code. The composition, typography, scene arrangement, and animation timing were authored for this project; the incorporated screenshots and ticket image come from the running application and its export function. Tool licenses do not replace the separate visual-asset provenance recorded above.

## Current 0.4 screen recording and cover (2026-09-27)

The current video captures actual application operations using Playwright's native Screencast API through Tabbit, then cuts the WebM clips and adds original Chinese subtitles with FFmpeg 9.0.1. The cover is a browser rendering of the project's original HTML and its actual exported ticket PNG. These authoring tools are not application dependencies; no tool binaries or runtime code are bundled in the MP4 or PNG. Source clips, timestamps, holds, file hashes, and the AI-generated demonstration-photo disclosure are documented in `delivery/recording-source/README.md` and `source-summary.json`. The previous HyperFrames/GSAP composition remains historical source, not the renderer for the current video.

## QR invitation generation (2026-09-27)

[qrcode-generator](https://github.com/kazuhikoarase/qrcode-generator), **2.0.4**, Copyright (c) 2009 Kazuhiko Arase, MIT. The unmodified npm ES module is bundled into the browser app to encode its invitation URL locally. No external QR service receives the URL. The lockfile retains the package integrity; a complete license is retained at `web/assets/licenses/qrcode-generator-MIT.txt` and below for runtime-package redistribution.

## Real collaboration catalogue (2026-09-27, MVP 0.4.0)

`web/js/map-catalogue.js` contains a manually curated set of **11 artists, 10 works, and 10 credited vocal collaborations**. It stores factual names, work titles, credited performers, version descriptions, source URLs, check dates, and outbound links. The per-work sources and the exact official video publishers are recorded in [real-catalogue-sources.md](references/research/2026-09-27/real-catalogue-sources.md).

- Primary sources include [JVR Music](https://www.jvrmusic.com.tw/), [Warner Music Taiwan](https://www.warnermusic.com.tw/), and official artist / label channels, including JVR, Cindy Yen, Jam Hsiao, JJ Lin, and Taihe Music. Exact pages, rather than these homepages, support each recorded collaboration in the source register.
- The 10 YouTube links were read through official oEmbed metadata to check titles and publishers on 2026-09-27. This is not evidence that the videos play in every region or account. The app opens external pages and does not embed, download, host, or supply music audio.
- The app does not copy lyrics, music recordings, artist photographs, album covers, or source-page artwork. Descriptions in the catalogue are independently written summaries of credited collaborations. Names and links do not imply artist endorsement, participation in a user-created event, or permission to reuse third-party media.
- The original fictional artist and song IDs remain a separately labelled demonstration catalogue. Real metadata is not presented as MusicBrainz data or as CC0: no MusicBrainz dataset was imported for this release, and the rights in the cited publication pages and media remain with their respective owners.
- The competition's restricted demo-song list was not downloaded or incorporated. Official external links do not expand that list's limited competition-use conditions.

## Open-source implementation research — no source code copied (2026-09-27)

The following repositories informed the 0.4 product and data design. They are research references, not bundled dependencies or copied implementation modules. The project independently implements its graph traversal, catalogue, room permissions, and exchange flow; this section does not claim their software licenses cover music, photographs, or other third-party content.

| Reference | License read | Limited design takeaway |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [MusicBrainz Server](https://github.com/metabrainz/musicbrainz-server) | Main code [GPL-2.0-or-later](https://github.com/metabrainz/musicbrainz-server/blob/master/COPYING.md); repository-specific exceptions are documented upstream | Stable artist identity and explicit recording credits; no server code or data dump imported |
| [ListenBrainz Troi](https://github.com/metabrainz/troi-recommendation-playground) | [GPL-2.0](https://github.com/metabrainz/troi-recommendation-playground/blob/main/LICENSE) | Separate candidate selection, filtering, and explanation; no recommender or API client incorporated |
| [Kreolis/musicmap](https://github.com/Kreolis/musicmap) | [MIT](https://github.com/Kreolis/musicmap/blob/main/LICENSE) | Relate a route to a sequence of works; no audio analyser, model weights, or graph implementation copied |
| [Snapdini](https://github.com/paytah232/snapdini) | [AGPL-3.0](https://github.com/paytah232/snapdini/blob/main/LICENSE); fonts have separate upstream notices | Clear event entry and a small set of photograph perspectives; no code, fonts, or assets copied |
| [PicPeak](https://github.com/PicPeak/picpeak) | [MIT](https://github.com/PicPeak/picpeak/blob/main/LICENSE) | Distinguish event access, upload permission, and attribution; no gallery code or assets copied |

Actual README / license / source-file reading scope and adoption decisions are recorded in [music-discovery-review.md](references/research/2026-09-27/music-discovery-review.md) and [social-product-review.md](references/research/2026-09-27/social-product-review.md). If a future change copies substantive code or assets, its actual version, license obligations, and modifications must be recorded separately. The QR library above is an actual bundled dependency and retains its own complete MIT notice.

## Sakura Crossing renderer and Three runtime (2026-09-27, introduced in MVP 0.6.0)

[Sakura Crossing](https://github.com/Kenton-GMI/sakura-crossing), fixed commit [`de01898e89c7f6ab3fad93fa802f0f5ac66fbd81`](https://github.com/Kenton-GMI/sakura-crossing/tree/de01898e89c7f6ab3fad93fa802f0f5ac66fbd81), supplies the **MIT rendering code adapted in 0.6.0**. Copyright (c) 2026 Kenton Wang. A complete [local MIT notice](web/assets/licenses/sakura-crossing-MIT.txt) accompanies the modules and is embedded in the distributable HTML.

- `web/js/vendor/sakura/toon.js`: cel material bands and tinted shadow shader patch, with scene-owned material and ramp caches.
- `web/js/vendor/sakura/post.js`: depth ink, color grading and FXAA. Adapted for an orthographic camera, local scene distances, DPR ≤ 1.5 and a 2-million-pixel target budget. Linear-to-sRGB conversion remains in the grade pass.
- `web/js/vendor/sakura/palette.js`: unmodified upstream palette.
- Exact upstream paths, SHA-256 values and changes: [SOURCE.json](web/js/vendor/sakura/SOURCE.json). Upstream Three 0.180.0 is adapted to the project's 0.186.1; the relevant shader anchor was read in the installed source.

`web/js/sakura-world.js`, `sakura-scene.js` and `sakura-camera.js` contain Music Map's original geometry, scene integration and camera direction. No upstream world, player movement, artwork textures or audio is distributed. Upstream stock audio is explicitly excluded from MIT and is not used. The earlier [0.5 visual-only research](references/research/2026-09-27/sakura-visual-reference.md) remains a historical record; the [0.6 adoption note](references/research/2026-09-27/indie-app-direction.md) describes the current scope.

[Three](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js), package **0.186.1**, is an actual browser runtime dependency for the independently authored scene. License: **MIT**, Copyright © 2010-2026 three.js authors. The complete license is copied to [web/assets/licenses/three-MIT.txt](web/assets/licenses/three-MIT.txt); `package-lock.json` records the exact package integrity. Vite retains the full copyright and permission notice in the standalone HTML, including the runtime package. Its presence in the 0.5 production output was read during integration.

## GSAP and Flip (MVP 0.7.0)

[GSAP](https://gsap.com/), pinned npm package **3.15.0**, supplies camera interpolation, UI entrance timelines and Flip card transitions. Copyright 2008–2026, GreenSock. All rights reserved. License: [Standard No Charge GSAP License](https://gsap.com/community/standard-license/), **not MIT**. The source copyright, author and license reference are retained in [gsap-notice.txt](web/assets/licenses/gsap-notice.txt) and embedded in the single HTML. No GSAP source modifications. This application does not expose an animation authoring tool.

The 0.8 scene remains original procedural geometry. Its full-viewport courtyard, open shop, stage, six photo slots, worktable, interior cabinet, instanced petals, cat, physical photo lift and interruptible desktop/portrait GSAP camera director are written for Music Map. Photo textures use only project examples or cards already authorized by the existing application. The vendor renderer modules and their pinned upstream commit remain as documented above.

## Hugging Face factual music metadata (MVP 0.7.0)

Source: [maharshipandya/spotify-tracks-dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/maharshipandya/spotify-tracks-dataset/tree/635b034f69257814eff850a5c2b3346fe458134f), revision **635b034f69257814eff850a5c2b3346fe458134f**. The upstream card labels the dataset `bsd`; it supplies no standalone LICENSE or specific BSD variant. This is recorded as stated, without inferring a broader music or recording license.

The full CSV (114,000 rows, 20,118,244 bytes) is downloaded locally under ignored `data/external/spotify-tracks-dataset/`. The distributed [120-record extract](web/assets/data/hf-collaborations.json) contains factual track names, credited artist names, album names and source record identifiers. It contains no audio, lyrics, artwork, listening URL, or detailed production-role claims. See [download record](references/research/2026-09-27/huggingface-download.md) and [reproduction script](scripts/datasets/download_hf_catalogue.py).

The 10 curated vocal collaborations use separate manually checked per-role sources. See [collaboration roles](references/research/2026-09-27/collaboration-roles.md); no HF artist field is used to infer those roles.

## Original courtyard printwork (MVP 0.11.0)

The procedural record sleeves, shop signage and wood-grain textures in web/js/sakura-printwork.js are original project artwork. The striped awning, detailed background houses, foliage and distant hills in sakura-world.js are original geometry. No third-party artwork or additional assets were downloaded for this iteration. Only the Sakura visual direction is exposed in the application and PNG exports; the renderer licenses above remain bundled.

## Original interactive record table (MVP 0.12.0)

`web/js/sakura-music.js` adds original procedural furniture, vinyl geometry, connecting threads and printed sleeve textures to the same courtyard scene. Artist names, collaboration titles and links come from the existing catalogues; the abstract sleeves are interface artwork, not official album covers. The projected labels, envelope controls, photo trays and album interface are original project code. No additional third-party assets, fonts or runtime libraries were introduced.

## TinyCLIP: on-device viewpoint model (2026-09-30)

`web/public/ai/tc8/vision.onnx` (8,807,127 bytes) is the **image tower of TinyCLIP-ViT-8M/16 with a 3M text tower (pre-trained on YFCC-15M)**, dynamically quantised to int8, and `web/public/ai/tc8/labels.json` holds four precomputed text vectors for the viewpoints stage / crowd / friends / detail. The browser runs it locally to suggest a viewpoint for a photo the person chose; the photo is not uploaded. The suggestion is advisory: this is a small zero-shot model, it can be wrong, and the person can always change the viewpoint.

- Method and code: Wu et al., "TinyCLIP: CLIP Distillation via Affinity Mimicking and Weight Inheritance", ICCV 2023; [microsoft/Cream](https://github.com/microsoft/Cream/tree/main/TinyCLIP) (`TinyCLIP/`).
- Checkpoint: [wkcn/TinyCLIP-ViT-8M-16-Text-3M-YFCC15M](https://huggingface.co/wkcn/TinyCLIP-ViT-8M-16-Text-3M-YFCC15M), revision `a2a8c6eaa2549ad66eb7c31b85022bf58273a26c`.
- ONNX export actually used: [onnx-community/TinyCLIP-ViT-8M-16-Text-3M-YFCC15M-ONNX](https://huggingface.co/onnx-community/TinyCLIP-ViT-8M-16-Text-3M-YFCC15M-ONNX), revision **`9463a9c508a344c837ffefe9d724f3827bf2dc79`**, file `onnx/model.onnx` (94,071,688 bytes, SHA-256 `31d28cb07209533d10fc4fef73ac324ce17de6741a2372e7e1531a4ac8fdaeb2`). Its card states it was converted automatically with the onnx-community/convert-to-onnx Space.
- License: **MIT**, Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. Read on 2026-09-30: `license: mit` on both Hugging Face model cards, and `TinyCLIP/LICENSE` in microsoft/Cream (file last changed in commit `f3a5fd8aef84b6c9bc35a9179311aa15928773e5`; that file also names CLIP, CoFi and OpenCLIP as MIT and PyTorch (eval) as BSD-style upstream code dependencies, none of which is distributed here). The complete text is copied verbatim to [`web/public/ai/tc8/LICENSE-TinyCLIP-MIT.txt`](web/public/ai/tc8/LICENSE-TinyCLIP-MIT.txt) and is deployed next to the model.
- Training data as stated by the cards: **YFCC-15M** (the checkpoint name and the upstream model-zoo row; manual weight inheritance; ImageNet-1k zero-shot top-1 41.1 % in that table). The cards state no dataset licence terms or bias analysis, and this project makes no claim about them. YFCC-15M is generally described as a 15M-image subset of Flickr's YFCC100M collection; that was not independently checked here.
- Local modifications, all offline and reproducible with [`scripts/ai/`](scripts/ai/README.md): (1) the vision tower (`pixel_values` to `image_embeds`) was extracted from `model.onnx`; (2) its weights were dynamically quantised to int8 with onnxruntime 1.30.0 `quantize_dynamic` (QUInt8); (3) four 512-d text vectors were computed with the unmodified fp32 text tower from seven English prompts per viewpoint (`scripts/ai/prompts.mjs`). The text tower is not distributed. No fine-tuning or further training was done. Commands and SHA-256 values of every intermediate and shipped file are in `scripts/ai/README.md`.
- Hosting: the model, `labels.json` and the runtime below are served from the app's own origin; nothing is loaded from huggingface.co or a CDN at run time.

## onnxruntime-web 1.30.0 (WebAssembly runtime for the model above)

[ONNX Runtime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime), npm package `onnxruntime-web` **1.30.0** (source tag `v1.30.0`, commit `f2c39fe2f838cf35ce7da92824f5a5e3ee6e88a7`), **MIT**, Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. It is a pinned devDependency; `npm run ai:ort` (run by `predev` and `prebuild`) copies three unmodified files from `node_modules/onnxruntime-web/dist` into `web/public/ai/ort/` (git-ignored, deployed as `ai/ort/`): `ort.wasm.min.mjs` (SHA-256 `219e6a1f…6cee3b`), `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.mjs` (`e13f7f94…c4299b`) and `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.wasm` (`3398c10d…42dee2`; full hashes in `scripts/ai/copy-ort.mjs`, which refuses any other content). It runs single-threaded on the WASM backend. The MIT text is copied verbatim from the tag's `LICENSE` to [`web/public/ai/LICENSE-onnxruntime-web-MIT.txt`](web/public/ai/LICENSE-onnxruntime-web-MIT.txt) and is deployed next to the runtime. The `.wasm` binary is a build of ONNX Runtime; upstream lists the notices of its own third-party components in [ThirdPartyNotices.txt](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/v1.30.0/ThirdPartyNotices.txt) at the same tag. That file covers every ONNX Runtime build and was not audited component by component for this WASM binary; it is linked here, not copied. The runtime's npm dependencies (`onnxruntime-common`, `flatbuffers`, `guid-typescript`, `long`, `platform`, `protobufjs`) are development-time only and are not part of the deployed output; `package-lock.json` retains their versions and integrity values.

## Capture-time reader (project code)

`web/js/ai/exif-time.js` reads the capture time (EXIF `DateTimeOriginal` and related tags, with time-zone offset) from a photo in the browser before it is recompressed. It is original project code with no third-party source and no dependencies. During development its output was compared with [exifr](https://github.com/MikeKovarik/exifr) 7.1.3 (MIT) and with values read by ExifTool on a small corpus of public test images; neither tool is included or distributed, and the test images are not committed.
